# SantaWishList
Make a wish list and send it to Santa

Project built around Spring Boot, Spring JPA and Thymeleaf. Add your wishes to your wish list and send it to Santa. Parents can add their email address to get a copy as well. 

Wish lists are saved to an H2 database for later viewing. Some sample data with users and wish lists are randomly generated on startup.
